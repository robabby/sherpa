# Changelog

Reverse-chronological record of integrated initiatives and their system impact.

## 2026-03-21 — Studio Zero-Downtime Deploy

Studio deploys now use blue-green slot swapping on the Hetzner VPS — zero dropped requests during deploys. Two standalone Next.js copies alternate at `/opt/sherpa/blue/` (port 3000) and `/opt/sherpa/green/` (port 3001). The deploy script builds, copies to the standby slot, health-checks, then atomically swaps the Caddy upstream via a snippet file and graceful reload. On health-check failure, the old instance keeps serving untouched.

**Initiative:** [studio-zero-downtime-deploy](initiatives/studio-zero-downtime-deploy/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline
**Key changes:**
- `output: "standalone"` in `apps/studio/next.config.ts` — self-contained deploy artifacts without shared `.next/` directory
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — blue-green orchestrator with `--skip-build` and `--rollback` modes
- `sherpa-studio@.service` systemd template parameterized by slot name
- Caddy upstream imported from `/opt/sherpa/studio-upstream.caddy` (deploy script rewrites on swap)
- `sherpa-sync.sh` updated to call `deploy.sh` instead of simple git pull for sherpa
- Tailscale serve on port 3000 removed (was causing EADDRINUSE); Studio binds `127.0.0.1` only
- `docs/templates/server-provision.md` updated with full blue-green setup section
- 2 sessions (estimated 2)

## 2026-03-20 — Research Markdown Renderer

Research detail page now renders markdown properly instead of displaying plain text. Swapped `whitespace-pre-wrap` div for the existing `DocRenderer` component — headings, bold, lists, links, code blocks, and tables all render in Luna's overnight research reports.

**Initiative:** [research-markdown-renderer](initiatives/research-markdown-renderer/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Studio Application
**Key changes:**
- Replaced plain-text rendering with `DocRenderer` in the research detail page (`/projects/{slug}/research/{category}/{date}`)
- Zero new dependencies — reused existing `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` infrastructure and `DocRenderer` component already used on 5 other pages

## 2026-03-20 — Multi-Project Studio

Extended Studio from a single-project tool to a multi-project hub following the Vercel model: Studio is the centralized governance dashboard, projects are data sources with `.sherpa/` dotfolders. Three projects now federated (Sherpa, WavePoint, robabby) with end-to-end research pipeline verified — Luna writes overnight research to `.sherpa/research/`, Studio renders it at `/projects/{slug}/research/{category}/{date}`.

**Initiative:** [multi-project-studio](initiatives/multi-project-studio/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Studio Application, Config-as-Code
**Key changes:**
- `sherpa.json` as canonical config format (ADR 0013) with `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation for cross-environment path resolution
- `.sherpa/` dotfolder convention with standard schema: initiatives, tasks, research, rules, skills, agents, db
- Three-directory model (ADR 0014): `.sherpa/` (tool data) + `.claude/` (agent config) + `docs/` (human prose)
- `ProjectContext` explicit parameter pattern (ADR 0015) replacing module-level globals — eliminates race conditions in multi-project Server Component rendering
- Project registry (`packages/studio-core/src/projects.ts`) with `initProjectRegistry()`, `getProject()`, `getProjectContext()`, `getAllProjects()`
- `loadJsonConfig()` with config discovery (`sherpa.json` → `.sherpa/config.json`) and env var interpolation
- `scaffoldDotfolder()` utility for project onboarding
- Project-scoped routes at `/projects/[project]/{process,tasks,research}`
- `ProjectSwitcher` component in sidebar header (Vercel pattern)
- Cross-project command palette search with project badges
- Research viewer (index + detail pages) scanning `.sherpa/research/` for markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Legacy route redirects via middleware (`/process` → `/projects/{primary}/process`)
- Breadcrumb project context in `StudioShellHeader`
- Research nav link (FlaskConical icon) in sidebar Knowledge group
- WavePoint and robabby registered with `.sherpa/config.json` in each repo
- VPS deployed with `SHERPA_PROJECTS_DIR=/root` in `.env.production`
- Luna's overnight cron updated to write to `.sherpa/research/` with auto-PR workflow
- 2 research iterations, 12-assumption stress test (1 refuted → redesign), 5 architecture decisions
- PRs: #13 (infrastructure, 23 commits, 44 files), #14 (activation), wavepoint #491, robabby #59-60
- 8 sessions (estimated 4-6, revised to 5-7 after stress test)

## 2026-03-19 — Studio Production Auth

Sherpa Studio and the MCP server are now auth-gated in production at `https://studio.sherpa.solar`. Better Auth (chosen over Supabase Auth via ADR 0012) provides dual-identity authentication: session cookies for humans, API keys (`sk_sherpa_` prefix) for agents. The VPS is hardened with Caddy (auto-TLS), CrowdSec (community IDS with 512MB memory cap), and a Lynis-verified security baseline.

**Initiative:** [studio-production-auth](initiatives/studio-production-auth/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Studio Application
**Key changes:**
- Better Auth v1.5 with `@better-auth/api-key` plugin — TypeScript-native, SQLite-backed, self-hosted, MIT licensed
- Route group restructure: `(studio)/` for authenticated routes, `auth/` for sign-in (separate layout, no sidebar)
- Next.js middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) — optimistic cookie check with `__Secure-` prefix support for HTTPS
- MCP server auth middleware (`packages/studio-mcp/src/auth/`) — API key + session cookie dual path, `/health` remains open
- `.sherpa/auth.db` — dedicated SQLite database shared between Studio and MCP via WAL mode
- Sign-in page with shadcn/ui Card + form components, user menu in sidebar footer (Avatar + DropdownMenu)
- `scripts/seed-auth-user.ts` and `scripts/generate-api-key.ts` — CLI tools for user/key management
- Environment validation (`src/env.ts`) with production fail-fast on missing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- DNS A record `studio.sherpa.solar` → VPS via Vercel DNS, Caddy reverse proxy with method-based MCP routing
- CrowdSec with firewall bouncer + console enrollment, Lynis hardening (umask 027, core dumps disabled)
- 4 sessions (shaped for 4, used 4)

## 2026-03-18 — VPS Remote Compute

Sherpa's agentic infrastructure moved from Rob's laptop to a dedicated Hetzner VPS (CPX31, 8GB RAM). OpenClaw gateway deployed as the always-on agent runtime, connected via Tailscale mesh VPN with auto-TLS. OpenClaw became the default dispatch backend for all task types, replacing the previous multi-provider routing. Studio runs as a production service accessible from any device on the tailnet. Luna (OpenClaw agent) has full codebase access with her own GitHub identity, CI integration, and overnight cron jobs.

**Initiative:** [vps-remote-compute](initiatives/vps-remote-compute/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline
**Key changes:**
- Hetzner CPX31 VPS with 10GB volume, UFW, fail2ban, Tailscale, Docker
- OpenClaw gateway via Docker Compose with persistent identity, git push, gh CLI access
- `scripts/backends/openclaw.mjs` — WebSocket protocol v3 backend with Ed25519 device auth
- `openclaw` added to `Backend` type in `dispatch-meta.ts` and MCP `task_create` enum
- `DEFAULT_DISPATCH` routes: all task types default to `openclaw` (ADR 0011)
- Studio production server (systemd) + MCP server (systemd) on VPS
- Luna's GitHub account (`luna-sherpa`), Vercel Developer access, Co-Authored-By convention
- Git sync cron (15 min), overnight task runner (1am), memory housekeeping (2am), morning briefing (6am)
- `docs/templates/server-provision.md` — repeatable runbook for future VPS provisioning
- 3 sessions (estimated 4-6)

## 2026-03-17 — Expose Initiative System via MCP

The initiative lifecycle — the core governance workflow — is now accessible via MCP. External agents can propose work, read what's in flight, approve proposals (policy-gated), and participate in governance through standard protocol. Seven new MCP tools backed by a filesystem CRUD operations module with Zod-validated frontmatter and lifecycle transition enforcement.

**Initiative:** [mcp-initiative-governance](initiatives/mcp-initiative-governance/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Governance Engine
**Key changes:**
- `packages/studio-core/src/initiative-ops.ts` — new CRUD operations module (list, get, seeds, create, approve, update_status, activity) with explicit `root` parameter and 25 tests
- `packages/studio-mcp/src/initiative/tools.ts` — 7 MCP tools following the authority tools registration pattern
- `packages/studio-core/src/config/` — new `governance` section with `approval.agents` policy (`'never'` | `'additive-only'` | `'always'`, default: `'never'`)
- Lifecycle transitions enforced via `VALID_TRANSITIONS` map — strict, no `--force` escape hatch in v1
- Authority gating on write tools when coordination DB is available
- 15 commits, 1 session (estimated 3)

## 2026-03-17 — MCP Multi-Backend Dispatch

Wired the MCP `task_create` and `task_dispatch` tools into the existing multi-backend dispatch infrastructure. Tasks created via MCP can now route to any configured backend (claude, gemini, codex, groq, etc.) instead of being hardcoded to lm-studio. `task_dispatch` delegates to `worker.sh` rather than reimplementing per-backend spawn logic.

**Initiative:** [mcp-multi-backend-dispatch](initiatives/mcp-multi-backend-dispatch/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline
**Key changes:**
- `packages/studio-mcp/src/server.ts` — `task_create` gains `backend` and `task_type` params, calls `resolveRoute()` for automatic routing; `task_dispatch` drops lm-studio-only gate, delegates to `worker.sh`
- `scripts/backends/claude.sh` — Skip `--max-budget-usd` when budget is zero (Claude CLI rejects 0.00)
- 5 route resolution tests, 3 backend infrastructure tests
- End-to-end verified: claude, gemini, codex, groq backends all dispatch and complete successfully
- 7 commits, 1 session (estimated 2)

## 2026-03-16 — Semantic Knowledge Engine

Built a queryable knowledge index that gives agents truthful, context-efficient access to system state through 4 MCP tools. Replaces O(n) filesystem scans with indexed queries — 537 files, 335 edges, 49 summaries, 245 inferred edges, 2 clusters, synced in 235ms. Pluggable backend architecture with zero-dependency algorithmic default (TF-IDF + extractive summaries).

**Initiative:** [semantic-knowledge-engine](initiatives/semantic-knowledge-engine/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline
**Key changes:**
- `packages/studio-core/src/db/knowledge-schema.ts` — 6-table schema (files, edges, FTS5, summaries, inferred_edges, clusters)
- `packages/studio-core/src/db/knowledge-sync.ts` — hash-based incremental sync from filesystem
- `packages/studio-core/src/db/knowledge-embeddings.ts` — embedding sync, inferred edges, clustering
- `packages/studio-core/src/db/classify.ts` — file classifier, edge extractor from frontmatter
- `packages/studio-core/src/knowledge/` — `KnowledgeBackend` interface, `AlgorithmicBackend` (TF-IDF), agglomerative clustering
- `packages/studio-core/src/config/types.ts` — `KnowledgeConfig` section in `sherpa.config.ts`
- `packages/studio-mcp/src/server.ts` — 4 MCP tools: `search_knowledge` (3 modes), `get_summary` (3 levels), `get_context` (4 roles), `query_related` (3 modes)
- `scripts/sync-knowledge-db.mjs` — `pnpm sync:db` CLI
- Session 6 waypoint: git hooks, file watcher, and Studio Settings page explicitly deferred — lazy sync sufficient
- 8 commits, 193 tests, 24/24 validation acceptance criteria pass

## 2026-03-16 — MCP Coordination Layer

Replaced stdio MCP transport with Streamable HTTP and built an authority lease system for multi-agent coordination. The MCP server now handles multiple concurrent Claude Code clients, each with independent sessions. Authority leases with globally monotonic fencing tokens enable safe concurrent access to shared files — though enforcement is deferred until autonomous dispatch is routine.

**Initiative:** [mcp-coordination-layer](initiatives/mcp-coordination-layer/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline
**Key changes:**
- `packages/studio-mcp/src/http-server.ts` — Streamable HTTP transport replacing stdio, multi-client session manager
- `packages/studio-mcp/src/authority/` — Schema, operations (acquire/release/renew/check), reaper, MCP tool registrations
- `packages/studio-mcp/src/dashboard.ts` — `get_dashboard` bootstrap tool returning leases, tasks, system summary
- Authority leases backed by SQLite `coordination.db` with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions
- Fence tokens globally monotonic via `fence_token_seq` counter table
- TTL reaper cleans expired leases every 60 seconds
- `authority://{scope}` MCP resource for read-only observation
- Decision: authority enforcement scoped to autonomous agents only (hooks deferred)
- 18 commits across 2 phases, 45 tests across 11 files

## 2026-03-16 — SQLite Agentic State Foundation

Introduced SQLite as Sherpa's embedded state store, following the Fossil SCM pattern: markdown files remain canonical, SQLite provides derived queryable indexes. Resolved circular dependency between sqlite-agentic-state and mcp-coordination-layer. Built the shared DB module that mcp-coordination-layer and semantic-knowledge-engine now build on top of.

**Initiative:** [sqlite-agentic-state](initiatives/sqlite-agentic-state/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline
**Key changes:**
- `packages/studio-core/src/db/` — connection factory with WAL mode, pooled connections, standard pragmas
- `coordination.db` schema: agent_sessions, task_claims (CAS via version columns), schema_version
- `events.db` schema: append-only audit trail with ULID-keyed events
- Barrel export at `@sherpa/studio-core/db` — consumed by mcp-coordination-layer and semantic-knowledge-engine
- Drizzle ORM composability validated — downstream consumers wrap raw connection with ORM
- `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` config for better-sqlite3 native addon
- 7 commits, 814 lines, 141 tests

## 2026-03-16 — Agent Narrative Streaming

Fills the black box between `dispatch_spawned` and `status_changed`. A sidecar script (`agent-log-streamer.sh`) tails backend output during dispatch, strips ANSI codes, batches lines, and emits `agent_output` events into the NDJSON event stream. New Log tab in the mission detail pane renders the full agent narrative as a terminal-style feed. Timeline collapses agent output into compact activity indicators.

**Initiative:** [agent-narrative-streaming](initiatives/agent-narrative-streaming/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline, Studio Application
**Key changes:**
- `scripts/agent-log-streamer.sh` sidecar for tailing backend output into NDJSON events
- Claude backend switched to `--output-format stream-json` for incremental output
- `agent_output` event type added to NDJSON schema (lines, batch, byteOffset)
- `MissionLogViewer` terminal-style component with auto-scroll and 1000-line cap
- Log tab added to mission detail pane (between Report and Verdict)
- Timeline collapses consecutive `agent_output` events into activity indicators
- Tested across Claude and Codex backends

## 2026-03-16 — Self-Documenting System

Introduced the self-documenting system: directoturtle convention elevated to first-class system-wide pattern, provenance metadata tracking authorship and review state on all maintained docs, `/integrate` skill for post-initiative documentation, `/doc-bootstrap` skill for history crawl and scaffolding.

**Initiative:** [self-documenting-system](initiatives/self-documenting-system/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Executable Conventions, Governance Engine
**Key changes:**
- Directoturtle convention rule (`.claude/rules/directoturtle-convention.md`)
- Provenance convention rule (`.claude/rules/provenance-convention.md`)
- `/integrate` skill for post-initiative documentation updates
- `/doc-bootstrap` skill for documentation surface generation
- Architecture documentation surface (`docs/architecture/`) with seven pillar docs
- Cross-cutting decision records (`docs/decisions/`)

## 2026-03-14 — Studio Agent Missions

Reimagined the tasks page as a mission control interface. Split-pane layout with scrollable task list and full detail view showing agent metadata (provider, model, duration, tokens, cost) and structured event timeline. Edge-to-edge viewport layout matching dispatch and process pages.

**Initiative:** [studio-agent-missions](initiatives/studio-agent-missions/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Studio Application
**Key changes:**
- Split-pane mission control layout replacing table-based task board
- Task cards with agent mission metadata
- Agent metadata header (provider, model, duration, token usage, cost estimate)
- Event timeline from NDJSON agent logs
- 14 tasks executed via subagent-driven development, 2,142 lines of code

## 2026-03-13 — Studio UX Patterns

Established five cross-cutting interaction patterns for the Studio app: command palette (Cmd+K global search), skeleton loading (loading.tsx with show-delay), functional empty states (actionable guidance), browser tab status (favicon + title updates), and URL-persisted filter state (search params across all pages).

**Initiative:** [studio-ux-patterns](initiatives/studio-ux-patterns/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Studio Application
**Key changes:**
- Command palette component with Cmd+K activation
- Loading skeleton pattern with delayed reveal
- EmptyState component with actionable guidance
- `usePageStatus` hook for browser tab status
- URL filter state persistence via search params

## 2026-03-11 — Voice and Tone

Comprehensive content standards for Sherpa: 3 business personas, 6 product personas, messaging framework (Dunford positioning + Raskin narrative + JTBD), agent voice guidelines mapping behavioral constraints to voice constraints, accessibility and inclusion standards, component content patterns for 8 UI component types.

**Initiative:** [voice-and-tone](initiatives/voice-and-tone/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Executable Conventions
**Key changes:**
- `docs/ux/personas.md` — 3 business personas
- `docs/ux/product-personas.md` — 6 product personas

- `.claude/rules/content-quality.md` — 8-criterion quality scorecard

## 2026-03-09 — Dispatch Center

The complete Planner/Worker/Judge execution pipeline: five CLI backends (claude, opencode, codex, gemini, lm-studio), three dispatch modes (interactive, supervised, overnight), task-type routing via `sherpa.config.ts`, Studio dispatch UI with three-panel layout, MCP server task tools, and budget allocation strategy.

**Initiative:** [dispatch-center](initiatives/dispatch-center/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Execution Pipeline, Studio Application
**Key changes:**
- `scripts/dispatch.sh`, `worker.sh`, `auto-judge.sh`, `dispatch-queue.sh`, `task-board.sh`
- `scripts/backends/` — 5 backend modules
- `apps/studio/src/app/dispatch/` — three-panel dispatch UI
- `packages/studio-core/src/dispatch.ts` — dispatch domain logic
- `packages/studio-core/src/tasks.ts` — task data model
- 52 files, 6,500+ lines across 5 sessions

## 2026-02-28 — Parallel Workflow Governance

Codified the three-layer coordination model for multi-agent work: worktree isolation conventions, initiative lifecycle with directoturtle directory structure, proposal-based shared artifact changes, and integration review for batch conflict resolution. The governance foundation that enables concurrent agent work.

**Initiative:** [parallel-workflow-governance](initiatives/parallel-workflow-governance/proposal.md)
**Pillar:** Governance Engine, Executable Conventions
**Key changes:**
- `.claude/rules/initiative-convention.md` — directoturtle structure, proposal format, seeds
- `.claude/rules/worktree-conventions.md` — isolation model, naming, lifecycle
- Three-layer coordination model: MCP (state) → Hooks (enforcement) → CLAUDE.md (guidance)
- Integration review workflow for batch proposal processing
